# Dijkstra's Algorithm
By Sasha Morgan

## Project Description

The run time of Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm can be significantly improved by using
a min-priority queue to keep track of the vertex with the lowest weight not currently in the
vertexSet. That is, the priority of a vertex in the queue is determined by the weight of its
current shortest path.
